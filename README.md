## Overview

Ask the Panel is a playful and personality-driven Q&A GenAI app. Users can ask any questions and keep a chat with four different characters:

ðŸ’Ž Tiffany Vandergilt â€“ A wealthy heiress from San Francisco

â›ª Don Andrea Bellucci â€“ An Italian priest with a peculiar spiritual wisdom

ðŸ”® Sibylla Naxos â€“ A Greek tarot reader (or con artist?)

ðŸ§¢ Chad â€“ A crypto bro

You can choose between a short or long response based on how detailed you want the answer to be. The application has contextual memory, so the character will remember your conversation so far.
